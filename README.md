### **Introduction**

This is a simple guessing game written in C#. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the number within a certain number of tries. The program provides feedback to the user after each guess to inform them if their guess is too high or too low.

### **How to Play**

1. Run the program
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field
3. If your guess is too low, the program will tell you to guess higher.
4. If your guess is too high, the program will tell you to guess lower.
5. If your guess is correct, the program will congratulate you and ask if you want to play again.

### **Code Overview**

The program uses the System namespace and the Random class to generate a random number. The Main method contains a loop that continues until the user correctly guesses the number or until they have used up all of their allowed guesses. The program uses the Console class to read the user's guess from the input and to provide feedback to the user.

### **Conclusion**

This simple guessing game is a great example of how to use loops, conditionals, and basic input/output in C#. With some modifications, it can be easily expanded into a more complex game with multiple levels or additional features.
